<h1>My Projects</h1>
<p>I've embarked on numerous projects throughout the years, but these are the ones I hold closest to my heart. Many of them are open-source, so if you come across something that piques your interest, feel free to explore the codebase and contribute your ideas for further enhancements. Your collaboration is highly valued!</p>
